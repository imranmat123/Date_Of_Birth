Exercise 4 on Udemy "Date of Birth" requires a C++ program that reads in and outputs the date of birth in the format of "mm dd yyyy". The code provided includes the standard main() function and three integer variables for the month, day, and year.

The exercise requires the student to write the code that reads in the date of birth from the console using the std::cin object and stores the input values in the corresponding variables. The student must then write the code that outputs the date of birth to the console in the specified format using the std::cout object and the insertion operator "<<".

Overall, this exercise provides practice with using the std::cin and std::cout objects to read in and output data, as well as working with variables in C++.
